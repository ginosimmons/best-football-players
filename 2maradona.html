                <h2>Diego Armando Maradona Franco</h2>
                <p>So what makes Diego Armando Maradona one of the greatest footballers of all time? Is it the fact that he won the FIFA World Cup in a way that no one else has ever been capable of doing - single handedly?Is it the fact that he scored the two most significant goals in footballing history?Is it the fact that one of these goals was the greatest goal of all time? The impossible made possible by a true genius?Is it the fact that he joined SSC Napoli - a downtrodden, unwanted, unfancied team - and made them the best team in the strongest league Europe has ever seen?Is it the fact that in his native land he is considered to be a God? A working class hero that empowered a nation through his messianic talent?It's all of the above.Diego Maradona, at his very best, is one of the greatest footballer we will ever see. Effective and exceptional in equal measure. </p>
