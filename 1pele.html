                    <h2>Edson Arantes do Nascimento</h2>
                    <p>Bursting onto the scene as a 17-year-old looking to avenge the tears of his father when Brazil lost the 1950 World Cup final, Pele would go on to win the World Cup on three separate occasions and make Brazil the football nation.</p>
                    <p>The Brazilian's peak is fable at this point, possibly because the world didn't really get to see it due to his injury at the 1962 World Cup, but more aptly because between 1958 and 1962, no one has ever scored more goals than him.</p>
                    <p>In fact, no footballer has ever scored more goals than Pele ever.</p>
